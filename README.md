# Private GPT-based Chatbot with Azure DevOps and SharePoint Data

Welcome to the repository for the private Azure GPT instance powered chatbot, designed for internal wikis and SharePoint documents.

We've got the *Ingestion* and *Chainlit* for the backend and frontend.

## Demo
Here are demos of how the chatbot works:

## Architecture Overview
![Architecture](architecture.jpg)

## Getting Started

To set up and run this application on your local machine, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- [Python](https://www.python.org) (version 3.11 or newer)
- An environment variables file (`.env` file) for every `.env.template`
- Docker Desktop
- API Keys from 1Password

## Running Locally
Create an `.env` file based on the structure provided in the `docker-compose.yaml` file. You can use the `.env.template` as a reference.

Then you can run the whole ingestion part with:
```sh
docker compose up --build
```
It will scrape everything from the wikis, filter and ingest to the local Redis image.
If you do not want to go through this process you can simply port forward the Redis instance from the Kubernetes cluster and use it as a local Redis instance.

In order to run the Chainlit app you need to go to the chainlit folder:
```sh
cd chainlit/src
```
Once you are there install the dependencies with from requirements.txt with:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Once they are installed run the app with:
```sh
chainlit run deployment_dev.py --port 9000
```

Donâ€™t forget to replace `https://github.com/template` with the actual URL to yer GitHub repository and add an image URL to the logo you want. In chainlit config.

## Ingestion ðŸ“œ
Arrr! This be where we plunder the high seas for knowledge! The Ingestion be responsible for gatherin' data from the wikis and feedin' it to private Azure GPT instanceâ€™s insatiable belly.

To read more about the ingestion, you can start by reading the [README.md](ingestion/README.md) in the ingestion folder.
Also consider reading about scraping in [azure-devops-scrape/README.md](ingestion/azure-devops-scrape/README.md) and filtering in [azure-devops-filter/README.md](ingestion/azure-devops-filter/README.md).

# Azure Pipelines Chainlit Script Documentation

This script is a YAML configuration file for Azure Pipelines, a cloud service that you can use to automatically build, test, and deploy your code.

## Overview

The script is divided into several stages and jobs, each with a specific purpose. The main stages are:

1. **CI**: This stage is responsible for building and pushing the Docker image to the Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).

## Detailed Breakdown

### Trigger

The pipeline is triggered when changes are pushed to the `main` branch or to the files in the `chainlit` directory or the `azure-pipelines-chainlit.yml` file itself.

### Resources

The pipeline uses the repository where the pipeline file is located (`self`).

### Variables

Several variables are defined for use throughout the pipeline, including secrets, the Docker image tag and name, and the AWS region.

### CI Stage

This stage consists of three jobs:

1. **CalculateVersion**: This job calculates the semantic version of the code using GitVersion. It also checks if a Git tag with the calculated version already exists. If not, it creates and pushes a new Git tag.

2. **Build**: This job depends on the completion of the `CalculateVersion` job. It builds a Docker image using the Dockerfile located in the `chainlit` directory and pushes the image to the ECR. It also sets the repository pull permissions and publishes the Kubernetes configuration files as a build artifact.

3. **CreateReleaseNotes**: This job depends on the `Build` job and is only executed if a new Git tag was created in the `CalculateVersion` job. It generates release notes using the `XplatGenerateReleaseNotes` task and publishes them to a wiki using the `WikiUpdaterTask`.

## Conclusion

This Azure Pipelines script provides a robust CI/CD pipeline for a Dockerized application, handling versioning, building and pushing Docker images, and generating and publishing release notes.
